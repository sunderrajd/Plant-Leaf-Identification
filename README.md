# Plant-Leaf-Identification
# Problem
The identification of plant species is fundamental for the effective study and management of biodiversity.

In a manual identification process, different characteristics of plants are measured as identification keys which are examined sequentially and adaptively to identify plant species. This manual identification can also lead to errors, as it can be difficult to accurately match those characteristics to those described in reference materials.

Moreover, the manual identification of plant species is a time-consuming process and requires a lot of expertise in the field, especially when dealing with large numbers of plants or unfamiliar species

# Proposed Solution
Automated identification systems based on computer vision and machine learning techniques provide an alternative and assistive approach for this task.

The proposed Deep Learning (DL) model consists of a CNN block for feature extraction and a classifier block for classifying the extracted features. The model will be able to identify plant species when given an image of its leaves.
